# Task Descirption
### Introduction

In automatic driving, we need to detect the surrounding obstacles based on the visual sensor, and also need to find the driving area according to the traffic rules. In the actual scene, we need keep balance between the precision & hardware resources. The resources are limited, we can't use too many models. Then multi-task learning is a good solution. In this task, we hope that you can use one model solve two problems: Object Detection & Drivable Area Segmentation. The datasets in this competition are using BDD 100K ( http://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/ ). Please enter the website to download datasets. For test set A and test set B, we selected a portion of the data in the BDD test set, and the player can download the list we selected.
